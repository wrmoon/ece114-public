# ECE114 Introduction to C/C++ Programming
This repo contains all of the publicly available code, tools and setup files for ECE114.
* `examples` contains code examples that I use in the slides and in-class demos
* `tools` contains useful tools, like the `ggg` tool to compile one file, and a Makefile
   that compiles all the c/cpp files in the current directory.
* `setup` contains the ECE114 profile, the default files in .vscode, and test files to
  make sure the installation went well.
